This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The project demonstrates basic web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content updates.

## Features

- **Two-player game:** Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on the grid.
- **Winner detection:** The game automatically detects and announces the winner or if the game is a draw.
- **Dynamic UI:** The current year is dynamically displayed in the footer, and the game board updates in real-time based on player actions.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the game board and other elements.
- **CSS:** Styles the game board, cells, and other components to create an attractive and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the game logic, including player turns, winner detection, and dynamic UI updates.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
- **styles.css:** The CSS file that styles the game board and other elements.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file that contains the game logic and DOM manipulation.
